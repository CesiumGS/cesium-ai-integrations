Cesium AI Integrations is a collection of reference integrations, experiments, and patterns that connect the Cesium ecosystem with AI systems such as LLMs, retrieval pipelines, and agent workflows. The goal is to help developers build geospatially aware applications that can reason about 3D data and geospatial context.

Built on open standards, these integrations are designed to be modular, composable, and easy to adapt for real-world products.

## 🚀 Get started

1. Browse the repository folders to find the integration or example relevant to your use case.
2. Follow the setup instructions in each integration’s README.
3. Use the examples as a starting point for your own applications and workflows.

## ✅ What’s inside

- Reference patterns for connecting Cesium apps to AI assistants and tools
- Approaches for grounding AI responses with geospatial context
- Example workflows for data ingestion, retrieval, and analysis
- Prototypes that demonstrate AI-assisted exploration of 3D geospatial content

## 📚 Documentation

- Each integration includes its own setup and usage guide.
- For general CesiumJS learning resources, see the [CesiumJS Learn hub](https://cesium.com/learn/cesiumjs-learn/).
